# Clojure for the Brave and True

Exercises solved, see `src/clojure-workbook/*.clj`

# Playing with ring

Using jetty, build uberjar and run via java as normal

```
$ lein uberjar
$ PORT=4711 java -jar target/clojure-workbook-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar
```

be aware that the build takes some time as the build runs all the exercises,
yeah not great but... oh well.
